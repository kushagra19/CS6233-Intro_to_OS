### Lab 6 - Kernel Module Program

This repository contains the source code and necessary files for a kernel module program developed as part of Lab 6. The program is designed to interact with the Linux kernel to extend its functionality.

### Prerequisites

Before using this program, please ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- A Linux-based system
- Superuser (root) privileges

### Usage

To build and load the kernel module, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the repository directory.

3. Open the terminal and execute the following commands:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

   This will build the kernel module.

4. To load the module into the kernel, run the following command:

   ```bash
   make load
   ```

   The module is loaded using `insmod` with superuser privileges.

5. To unload the module, run the following command:

   ```bash
   make unload
   ```

   This command removes the module using `rmmod` with superuser privileges.

6. To clean the project and remove any generated files, execute:

   ```bash
   make clean
   ```

### Important Note

Please ensure you have the necessary privileges to load and unload kernel modules. The use of `sudo` in the `make load` and `make unload` commands is necessary to execute these actions as the superuser.
